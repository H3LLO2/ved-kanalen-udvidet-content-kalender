## Key Constraints

1. **7 days production time minimum** from receiving materials to posting
2. **Once a phase is planned and started, it's locked** - significant changes billed separately
3. **Client owns all content** once paid
4. **Dates are guidelines** - final dates depend on actual opening day

---

## What This Tool Must Enable

This rebuild must help fulfill the above deliverables:

1. **Process 100+ photos** efficiently across both phases
2. **Generate 90 unique posts** that don't repeat premises
3. **Maintain strategic continuity** over 90 days
4. **Match photos to narrative phases** (build-up → opening → establishment)
5. **Output ready-to-post content** for FB & IG
6. **Allow manual review and editing** before final posting
7. **Track which photos have been used** (never reuse)
8. **Support phase transitions** (strategy changes at day 30)
